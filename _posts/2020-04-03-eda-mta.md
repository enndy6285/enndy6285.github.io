title: Exploring MTA turnstile data
---

To kick off our journey at [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com), our project team was enlisted by the hypothetical group WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) to help with their upcoming summer gala. Using public turnstile data from NYC's MTA subway system, we were tasked to make recommendations for their street team. Let's get started.


### Learning to think like a Data Scientist
Before diving into the data, it was important for us to hone in on what questions exactly we are trying to answer. This means thinking about what can provide the most value to our client WTWY. Let's pick out some details from their initial contact:

>[...] optimize the effectiveness of our street team work, which is a **significant portion of our fundraising efforts**. [...] As we are **new and inclusive organization**, [...] fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the **participation of women in technology**, and to concurrently build awareness and reach. [...] such that we can gather the **most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala** and contribute to our cause.

Some potential takeaways:
* The summer gala is very important to WTWY as it comprises a large part of their fundraising
* WTWY self-describes as a "new organization". This may mean they are smaller, making it vital to allocate resources as efficiently as possible.
* We want to maximize the number of signatures we can get
* We want to get signatures from people who will attend the gala


### The Dataset
The data is publically available on the [MTA's webpage](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). Each line of data gives us the following information:
* Turnstile location - C/A, UNIT, SCP, STATION, LINENAME
* Time - DATE, TIME
* Foot traffic - ENTRIES, EXITS

Cleaning the data, we can see that it was collected as a running counter, usually every 4 hours. By finding the difference in ENTRIES from the previous collection, we can determine how many new entries occured at a turnstile during a given time interval.

We decided to look at data from the month of June 2019. This would give us an estimate of subway station foot traffic around the time leading up to when the summer gala is expected to occur. 


### Insights
We first aggregated the data for the entire month to get total entries through each station. We can then sort to find the top overall stations by total foot traffic.

Next we wanted to see how this varied over time. Breaking the data down by day of the week, it is clear traffic is higher on weekdays and drops significantly on the weekday. This pattern is consistent among all of our top stations.

Recalculating the total station entries during weekday onlys, the top stations remains almost the same, with Fulton St and 42 St-Port Authority swapping the 4th and 5th positions.

Each day can then further be broken by time of the day. We can now see that highest traffic occurs during the evening hours of 4-8 pm. Intuitively, this checks out as this would align with the return work commute.

### Conclusions and Future Work
Based on these results, we would recommend WTWY focus their resources at the following stations, on weekdays between 4 and 8pm.
1. Grand Central and 42nd Street
2. 34th Street and Herald Square
3. 14th Street and Union Square
4. Fulton Street
5. 42nd Street and Port Authority

Thinking more for our client, there is one aim that we haven't yet honed in on which would be great to explore in the future. Namely, how can we target NYC subway riders who are most likely to attend the gala? This would include looking into characteristics of previous gala attendees. We would also want to incorporate proximity data to see how these top stations relate geographically to major tech companies in NYC. Also, would there be value in sending team members to local universities to recruit students who are interested in the cause of women in tech? Just a few things we can explore next.
