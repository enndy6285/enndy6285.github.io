title: Text Preprocessing for NLP
---

### Introduction
Yelp is one of the largest platforms for customer generated business reviews with over 211 milion cumulative reviews to date. This wealth of information is valuable not only to consumers but the businesses themselves. A five star rating is the goal of every restaurant but what distinguishes a 5-star restaurant?

### Objective
The goal of this project is to use NLP techniques to analyze Yelp text reviews in order to gain insight on features that are predictive of a 5-star rating.

### The Data
Data was obtained from the Yelp Open Dataset available at [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset). It was uploaded into MongoDB. A subset consisting of Toronto restaurant reviews was then downloaded for analysis

### Methodology
Today we will focus on text preprocessing and how this affects our final analysis. NLTK packages were used for processing. Output we will be looking at will be topics generated after text vectorization (TF-IDF) and topic modeling (NMF, number of topics set at 50).

### Text Preprocessing
Text preprocessing serves as the backbone of NLP. The phrase "garbage in, garbage out" certainly applies here. 

#### Basic Text Cleaning
First we will do some basic cleaning including removing special characters, punctuation, and capitalizations. This can be performed with regular expressions:

```
text = re.sub('\w*\d\w*', ' ', text)
text = re.sub('[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation), ' ', text.lower())
```

Sample topics produced from topic modeling:
>Topic  0 - salad, steak, dressing, greek, pasta, ordered, kale, caesar, bread, side
 Topic  1 - food, service, excellent, fast, slow, bad, authentic, ok, indian, customer
 Topic  2 - us, table, came, server, asked, minutes, told, said, waitress, got
 Topic  3 - sushi, sashimi, roll, rolls, salmon, ayce, tempura, fish, japanese, maki
 Topic  4 - pizza, crust, toppings, pizzas, pasta, thin, slice, italian, sauce, pepperoni
 Topic  5 - ramen, broth, tonkotsu, noodles, miso, egg, kinton, bowl, spicy, shoyu

#### Stemming
Next will use stemming to reduce word tokens to their base form. This will consolidate words including plural forms such as "pizza" and "pizzas" seen above. The stemmer used was NLTK's SnowballStemmer.

Sample topics:
>Topic  0 - us, ask, tabl, server, even, one, came, said, becaus, bill
 Topic  1 - great, atmospher, spot, awesom, experi, select, vibe, fantast, valu, music
 Topic  2 - wait, minut, long, line, hour, seat, tabl, worth, get, min
 Topic  3 - sandwich, bread, chees, veal, bun, grill, brisket, tri, bacon, meat
 Topic  4 - pizza, crust, top, pasta, slice, thin, chees, sauc, italian, pepperoni
 Topic  5 - sushi, sashimi, ayc, qualiti, japanes, piec, salmon, tempura, chef, eat

#### Stop Words
It looks like we have some reasonably logical topics with a notable grouping by type of cuisine. While this may be interesting, this information is already captured by other Yelp metadata (business categories) and not particularly useful to an individual restaurant. Therefore I tried removing food object related words through the use of stopwords. So far we have been using a basic set of english stopwords included in the NLTK package. While there is not a separate food word list, we can create one using NLTK's wordnet. We can also manually add additional food item words.

```
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

stop_words = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')

food = wn.synset('food.n.02')
food_words = set([w for s in food.closure(lambda s:s.hyponyms()) for w in s.lemma_names()])
food_words = list(f.strip('_').replace('_',' ').lower() for f in food_words)

more_stop_words = ['cream', 'chicken', 'burger', 'pizza', 'milk', 'pickl',
                    'kimchi', 'sushi', 'ramen', 'thai', 'dim', 'tea', 'banh', 'khao',
                   'indian', 'korean', 'chines', 'noodl', 'tom yum',
                   'fast food', 'food court', 'toronto', 'place',
                  'back', 'recommend', 'better', 'best', 'noth', 'favourit', 'favorit', 'star',
                   'disappoint', 'love', 'definit']

stop_words.extend(food_words)
stop_words.extend(more_stop_words)
```

Sample topics:
>Topic  0 - restaur, japanes, area, sum, italian, mani, famili, decor, authent, high
 Topic  1 - great, atmospher, spot, awesom, vibe, select, fantast, valu, music, patio
 Topic  2 - us, ask, tabl, server, came, said, told, bill, waitress, even
 Topic  3 - food, authent, qualiti, atmospher, court, mediocr, mexican, fast, experi, bad
 Topic  4 - good, pretti, overal, valu, thing, bake, usual, choic, ambienc, look
 Topic  5 - veri, tasti, also, well, attent, clean, busi, pleasant, lot, happi

#### N-grams
After adding additional stop words, we can see more words related to restaurant characteritics we are trying to capture such as taste, service, and atmosphere. Ideally we would like to associate these with sentiment words to differentiate between "good service" and "great service" for example. To do this we can change from tokenizing the text to single words to bigrams and trigrams. This is done during vectorization by setting 'ngram_range'. Below we can see the results.

Final sample topics:
>Topic  0 - portion size, good portion, good portion size, lunch special, small portion, size great, price portion, portion size great, great portion, price portion size
 Topic  1 - food great, food great servic, great food great, great price, food great price, good food great, food great atmospher, delici food great, amaz food great, servic food great
 Topic  2 - veri good, also veri, also veri good, food veri good, veri good food, servic veri good, veri good servic, good veri, veri good price, tast veri good
 Topic  3 - food good, good price, food good servic, good food good, food good price, great food good, food good portion, servic food good, good atmospher, time food good
 Topic  4 - great food, great food great, servic great food, great food servic, great food good, staff great food, staff great, great food amaz, great food awesom, atmospher great food
 Topic  5 - realli good, food realli, food realli good, also realli, realli good food, servic realli, also realli good, realli nice, servic realli good, realli realli

### Conclusion
After text preprocessing, out topics have changed quite dramatically. We were able to extract information from the yelp review text that hopefully restaurants would find useful as constructive feedback. Text preprocessing may not be the most glamourous aspect of the NLP process but can have profound effects on our output.
